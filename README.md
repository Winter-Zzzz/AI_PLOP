# PLOP Web Cam

### MATTER Tunnel based AI Application

## Proposal

Our team proposes an AI environment called "PLOP" based on MATTER Tunnel. Additionally, this document will explain the process of creating an AI application called "PLOP Web Cam" using PLOP. PLOP is a technology that utilizes MATTER Tunnel to safely and efficiently use the user's local computing resources, transforming them into a dedicated server that can only be accessed by the user's applications and IoT devices. By running a simple program, this can provide AI capabilities to IoT devices. AI capabilities include computer vision, classification models, or any AI function the user desires, including ChatGPT. PLOP Web Cam will provide a service where the Web Cam provides photo data to the local computer, and the computer analyzes the photo to notify the user's application about visitor presence. AI will operate through a process of determining visitor presence by applying transfer learning to add images of family members to a pre-trained model, appropriately preprocessing input images, and analyzing the model's output. Through the implementation of PLOP Web Cam, we present a new webcam system that maximizes user convenience while providing end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
